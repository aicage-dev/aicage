## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.5] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- Missing extensions no longer abort the run in `--menu none` mode; unavailable extensions are automatically removed
  with a log warning and the run continues.
- Unknown agent names now list the available agents in the error message.

### Changed

- Separated Textual config and execution into independent apps, so image pull/build progress displays in a dedicated
  screen rather than being inlined in the config overview.
- Image update confirmation is now resolved at the interaction layer instead of inside decision logic, allowing each
  menu mode to handle confirmation consistently.
- The Textual base selection screen now accepts on row click instead of requiring the OK button.
- Tab/Shift+Tab navigation in the Textual extensions screen now cycles between checkboxes and the OK button.

### Internal

- Replaced the global mutable prompt-mode flag with a `RuntimeInteraction` protocol backed by `SimpleInteraction`,
  `TextualInteraction`, and `_NoneInteraction`, giving each menu mode explicit control over default and confirmation
  behavior.
- Renamed prompt modules to private (`_base`, `_confirm`, `_extensions`, `_image_ref`) and removed per-prompt log
  noise.
- Moved Textual screens into `views/` and extracted execution and image-update apps from the monolithic config app.
- Extracted `extended_image_name` into `config.image_refs` to remove inline duplication.
- Injected mount-prompt callables into docker-args resolution to decouple from concrete prompt implementations.
- Tightened module and function visibility across config, docker, and runtime packages.
- Updated README with the Antigravity CLI agent (`agy`).

## [1.4.4] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Fixed the Textual setup view so local image builds no longer start hidden preflight work before progress is shown.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Fixed the Textual setup view so image preparation no longer appears blank before the container starts.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Fixed the default Textual setup flow so pressing `OK` no longer triggers a second image setup pass before the
  container starts.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Fixed the published PyPI package for `1.4.x` releases so `aicage` installs and starts correctly again when
  installed from PyPI.

### Internal

- Added a release smoke test that installs the built wheel and runs `aicage --version` before publishing to PyPI.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- Added a Textual-based configuration UI as the default interactive setup for `aicage <agent>`. It replaces the old
  prompt-by-prompt flow with a single overview where users can review and adjust base image, extensions, bind mounts,
  Docker socket access, and Docker arguments before starting.

### Changed

- Replaced `--yes` with `--menu textual|simple|none` to support the new UI while still allowing the classic
  line-based prompts or a no-menu defaults flow.
- Existing per-project agent configs can now be changed from the interactive UI instead of often requiring config
  removal and a fresh setup.
- Added an inline execution view in the Textual UI so required image pulls and builds report progress before the
  container starts.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-07-11

### Changed

- Adapted the runtime environment passed into `entrypoint.sh` to a simplified contract.
- Added rootless Docker daemon support, including automatic runtime detection and correct Docker endpoint/socket
  handling, so `aicage` can run cleanly in setups that prefer a more locked-down container environment.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- `aicage` now works correctly from forked repositories by accepting fork-owned image signatures and matching forked
  image source metadata during verification.
- Show a TTY pull progress bar while Docker images download, so large first-time pulls no longer look idle and
  still keep the raw pull event log unchanged.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- Improved the home-mount refusal message with clearer guidance.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- Added Arch Linux as a built-in base image option on `amd64` hosts.

### Changed

- Base selection now respects per-base CPU architecture support, so incompatible bases are hidden on unsupported
  hosts.
- Custom base definitions now require an `architectures` list in `base.yml` or `base.yaml` using `amd64` and/or
  `arm64`.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Added the Antigravity CLI agent as `Antigravity` (`agy`).

### Internal

- Synced bundled agent install/version scripts with the current upstream agent images.
- Hardened releases to fail when a pushed tag does not point to a commit on `main`.
- Bumped pinned GitHub Actions and the `ruff` development dependency.

## [1.1.8] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed

- Improved Goose agent image compatibility by installing the required Vulkan loader during agent setup and by
  excluding `node` bases whose bundled glibc is too old for current Goose releases.

### Internal

- Hardened CI to fail workflows that reference GitHub Actions by mutable refs instead of immutable commit digests.
- Bumped development tool versions for `check-jsonschema`, `pyright`, `pymarkdownlnt`, and `ruff`.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- Prompt before pulling a newer remote `aicage` or `aicage-image-base` image when a local image is already
  available, and show the full image reference in the prompt text.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-19

### Changed

- Pass the host timezone into container runs via `TZ`, with host timezone detection split into a dedicated runtime
  module and covered by focused tests.

### Internal

- Bumped `actions/upload-artifact` from `7.0.0` to `7.0.1` in the GitHub Actions integration workflows.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-04-09

### Internal

- Reverted the release workflow package SBOM generation added in `1.0.10`.

## [1.0.10] - 2026-04-09

### Internal

- Generate and upload a CycloneDX SBOM for the built wheel as a separate release artifact.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-04-09

### Changed

- Authenticate release lookups with `GITHUB_TOKEN` when available.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- Print a short error message for unexpected CLI exceptions and write the full traceback to the log.

### Changed

- Require expected OCI manifest annotations when verifying official remote `aicage` images.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-30

### Changed

- Allow `aicage --config` without an explicit subcommand and treat it as `info`.
- Extensions can now define share mounts.

### Internal

- Switched config schema validation to `jsonschema`.
- Moved repository rule tests into `tests/repo_rules`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-26

### Changed

- Confirmed macOS support by GitHub-hosted integration tests.

## [0.9.48] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed

- Preserve nested child mounts when they override the parent mount access mode, so child `:ro` or read-write
  mounts are no longer dropped when the parent path is also mounted.

## [0.9.42] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- Allow verification of images signed by GitHub Actions workflows from any repository in the `aicage` org, not only
  `aicage/github-actions`.

## [0.9.41] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- Normalize interactive extension selections to prompt order so the same selected extensions produce the same default
  extended image name regardless of input order.

## [0.9.40] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- Allow verification of images produced by `aicage/github-actions` reusable workflows referenced by commit digest, not
  only by `refs/...` identities.

## [0.9.29] - 2026-03-17

### Internal

- Added Dependabot version update configuration and explicit dependency version ranges for runtime and development
  dependencies.
- Pinned GitHub Actions to commit digests and refreshed the GitHub Actions dependency set.
- Split the reusable test suite from the release workflow so pull requests run change validation separately while
  releases remain gated by tests.

## [0.9.28] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- After a successful `aicage` self-update, the CLI now restarts with the same arguments so the updated version runs
  immediately in the current invocation.

## [0.9.27] - 2026-02-27

### Changed

- Clarified base image selection prompts to explicitly say that pressing Enter accepts the default selection.

## [0.9.26] - 2026-02-27

### Changed

- Documentation refresh release: updated user-facing `README.md` content and examples (including setup flow and
  screenshots) for improved first-use guidance on PyPI.

## [0.9.25] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- Allow mounting `~/.ssh` and `~/.gnupg` together when both are needed (for example SSH remotes plus GPG commit
  signing), instead of treating them as mutually exclusive in Git support mount preference resolution.

## [0.9.24] - 2026-02-26

### Changed

- Mount host paths directly to their target container paths (including paths under host home) instead of routing
  through `/aicage/user-home`.
- Added nested mount de-duplication in Docker mount resolution so parent mounts take precedence over overlapping child
  mounts.

### Internal

- Refactored mount mapping/dedup logic into `runtime.docker_args.resolve._mounts` and kept resolver orchestration
  focused on provider composition.
- Added integration coverage for direct home mounts, parent-path ownership behavior, and nested mount de-duplication.

## [0.9.22] - 2026-02-26

### Changed

- Expanded SSH key mount detection and prompting to cover repositories with SSH Git remotes, not only SSH-based
  commit signing.
- Updated SSH mount prompt/config wording to reflect Git SSH access (push/fetch) in addition to signing.

## [0.9.21] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- Added `-y/--yes` to apply default answers for all prompts in non-interactive runs.

### Changed

- Reworked the Git support mount prompt to allow selecting specific mount targets via comma-separated option numbers,
  with Enter applying the default `all` selection.
- Prompt flows now auto-select defaults without rendering interactive questions when `-y/--yes` is set.
- Default base selection now derives from host Linux distro metadata (`ID` and `ID_LIKE`) and matches against
  available configured bases, including custom base names; fallback remains `ubuntu`.

### Internal

- Updated Git support prompt and resolver unit tests for per-mount selection behavior.
- Added prompt unit coverage for host-aware default-base resolution and prompt default propagation.
- Hardened integration tests against Docker daemon differences where local replacement images may not expose
  `RepoDigests` for the retagged repository, by using replacement-reference-aware assertions.

## [0.9.20] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- Added `--config remove [<agent>]` support to remove a single agent entry from a project's config file without
  deleting the full file.
- Added host proxy env forwarding for image builds and runtime (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`,
  `NO_PROXY`) to improve support behind corporate proxies.

### Changed

- Expanded `--help` output with clearer argument descriptions and behavior notes.
- Clarified `--` separator behavior in help: it is required only when Docker args are present before the agent.
- Improved network failure diagnostics for version and registry checks with structured categories (for example DNS,
  TLS, and proxy auth failures).

### Internal

- Added proxy integration tests and CI coverage.

## [0.9.19] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed

- Allow local agent runs to continue in offline scenarios when remote base digest verification fails but a usable
  local image is already available (local base digest fallback and local final-agent image fallback).
- Added explicit timeouts for host and builder-container agent version checks to prevent offline hangs.
- For local agents, fall back to a cached agent version when host and image-based version checks fail offline, instead
  of hard-exiting.

### Changed

- Centralized timeout constants in `aicage.constants`.
- Split Docker timeouts by operation type: short timeout for local Docker metadata queries, long timeout for image
  pulls, and short timeout for registry JSON lookups.

## [0.9.18] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- Added the `opencode` agent definition (install/version scripts and default config/state directories) synced from
  `aicage-image`.

### Changed

- Custom base rebuild checks now rely on image existence, build record metadata, and source digest changes; they no
  longer use rootfs layer comparison against the `from_image`.
- Simplified base-layer validation flow by making `base_layer_missing` return a boolean directly and centralizing the
  "missing local layer data" warning inside that helper.
- Synced bundled agent definitions with `aicage-image`, including the `goose` config directory updates.

## [0.9.16] - 2026-02-15

### Changed

- Refactored registry build structure into clear packages (`agent_build`, `base_build`, `extension_build`) and moved
  agent version checks under `agent_build.agent_version`.
- Unified agent/base/extension ensure orchestration through a shared build flow helper.
- Aligned build failure semantics so build errors propagate consistently across all three build flows.
- Standardized module and method naming across the build packages for clearer responsibilities.

## [0.9.15] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed

- Keep source image tags after successful local builds (agent images, extension images, and custom base images) so
  subsequent runs can reuse local tag metadata and avoid an unnecessary extra pull.

### Internal

- Updated integration tests around base-layer rebuild flows to assert the retained source-tag behavior.

## [0.9.14] - 2026-02-14

### Changed

- Clean up superseded image digests after `docker run` exits, including cases where cleanup could not happen during
  pull because another process was still using the image.
- Clean up superseded digests after local rebuilds of agent images, extension images, and custom base images.
- Remove source image tags after successful local builds to keep local image tags cleaner while preserving reusable
  layer content.

### Added

- Added integration coverage for image cleanup across pull, run, and local rebuild flows.

### Internal

- Refactored integration tests around cleanup scenarios to use real Docker behavior, unified helpers, and reduced
  duplication.
- Performed follow-up test/code cleanup (visibility alignment, static non-instance tests, fixture reuse, and naming
  cleanups).

## [0.9.11] - 2026-02-05

### Changed

- Switched `agent_path` to explicit `files` and `directories` lists and made it optional in agent definitions.
- Stop creating host paths for `--share` mounts; missing files or directories must exist on the host.

### Added

- Added integration coverage for creating and mounting `agent_path` files and directories for custom agents.

### Fixed

- Print underlying Docker stderr when container startup fails to improve error visibility.

### Internal

- Split `runtime.docker_args` into resolver implementations plus shared support/resolve helpers, and reorganized
  associated tests to match the new package layout.
- Update integration coverage for `agent_path` to use a custom bash agent with a reusable setup helper.

## [0.9.10] - 2026-02-05

### Changed

- Set `AICAGE_WORKSPACE` to the host path in container form, even when the mount is routed through
  `/aicage/user-home`.
- Added `AICAGE_HOME` and `AICAGE_HOST_IS_LINUX` to the entrypoint env contract and removed `AICAGE_USER`.

### Internal

- Updated env/mount tests for the revised entrypoint env contract.

## [0.9.9] - 2026-02-04

### Changed

- Unified mount resolution to map host-home paths into `/aicage/user-home`, keeping container user homes clean.
- Centralized mount/env-var resolution across project, agent config, git, shares, and Docker socket support.

### Fixed

- Improve home-directory mount guard errors to include the offending host path.

### Internal

- Isolate tests from the real host home directory via a temporary test home.

## [0.9.8] - 2026-02-03

### Added

### Changed

- Use Docker `--mount` instead of `-v/--volume` for `docker run` mounts.

### Internal

- Refactored Docker run helpers and expanded mount tests.
