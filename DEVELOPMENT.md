# Development Guide

This repo ships the `aicage` CLI. Image build logic lives in the other git-repos of owner `aicage`; this file is for
advanced/power users who want to tweak or extend things.

## Repo layout

- [README.md](README.md): end-user overview.
- [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md): instructions for AI coding agents.
- `src/`: the `aicage` CLI implementation.
- `tests/`: Python tests for the CLI.
- `scripts/`: helper scripts.
- `doc/`: task notes for AI agents.

## Related projects (build docker images)

- [aicage-image-base/](https://github.com/aicage/aicage-image-base): builds base OS layers.
- [aicage-image/](https://github.com/aicage/aicage-image): builds agents on those bases.
- [aicage-image-util/](https://github.com/aicage/aicage-image-util): builds utility images for aicage runtime tasks.

## Local checks

Run `scripts/lint.sh` from an active virtualenv with `requirements-dev.txt` installed.

## Integration tests

Integration tests are opt-in because they require Docker and network access. Run them with:

```bash
AICAGE_RUN_INTEGRATION=1 pytest -m integration
```

## Hosted runner coverage

GitHub-hosted macOS runners are only used for a small manual smoke subset. The full integration suite should stay on
Linux.

- macOS: use the dedicated hosted workflow for occasional smoke verification of interactive startup, local agent
  builds, extension builds, and `--docker` behavior on a non-Linux host.
- Windows: verify manually on a local machine with the intended Docker Desktop + WSL2 setup.
- Full integration suite: keep it on Linux. Several tests assert Linux-only details such as `/proc/self/mountinfo`,
  `mountpoint`, and `stat -c`, so broad cross-platform execution would add noise without adding much signal.
